# Changelog

All notable changes to REST Against Humanity will be documented here. Breaking changes are marked with a ðŸš©.

REST Against Humanity adheres to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## <a name="3-0-0">[3.0.0] - 2023-05-11</a>

### Changed

- ðŸš©REST Against Humanity is now a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) API. It's my hope that moving to GraphQL will increase
  the accuracy and reliability of the API's responses as well as the ease of adding new features without releasing a new
  major version. ([Docs](https://restagainsthumanity.com/gql)) - Versions 2 and 1 of REST Against Humanity remain available and unchaged at [restagainsthumanity.com/api/v2](https://restagainsthumanity.com/api/v2)
  and [restagainsthumanity.com/api/v1](https://restagainsthumanity.com/api/v1), respectively.

## <a name="2-1-0">[2.1.0] - 2023-03-25</a>

### Changed

- REST Against Humanity's documentation has moved from [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) to [Material for
  MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). This brings a few changes to the documentation's URL
  scheme:
  - The latest version of the documentation is now always accessible at https://restagainsthumanity.com.
  - The documentation for a specific version of REST Against Humanity is now accessible at
    https://restagainsthumanity.com/version, where `version` is the version of the documentation you wish to
    access. You can also simply go to https://restagainsthumanity.com and use the dropdown menu to jump to your desired
    version.
- This release **does not change** the REST Against Humanity API.

## [2.0.0] - 2023-02-21

This is the first versioned release of REST Against Humanity.

### Added

- ðŸš©REST Against Humanity is now a versioned API. Its versioning scheme will adhere
  to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) as closely as possible.

### Changed

  major version of the API you wish to access. - The previous, unversioned, release of REST Against Humanity has been retroactively dubbed Version 1 and is
  accessible at `https://restagainsthumanity.com/api/v1/`.
  - `https://restagainsthumanity.com/api/` will **always** redirect to Version 1.
